Keylogger is a type of spyware used to record the keystrokes done by users.
In most cases, cybercriminals employ keyloggers to observe the victim's keystrokes and take the information from their computer or other computing devices.
The keyloggers are generally in two categories. The first category of keyloggers is injected into the user's device to steal information through the keystrokes.
In that case, cybercriminals mainly emphasised the stealing of credentials like user IDs and passwords that they use to log in to any website or any application.
Every keystroke is recorded by the keyloggers and sent to the cybercriminals. In this process, cybercriminals steal confidential information through the keylogger.
 
The present data (from the CIC website) contains 523617 keyloggers and benign samples. The distribution of the classes is as follows:
